# C++

For this activity, we will develop an algorithm in C++ that allows us to create a calculator with main functions (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, factorial) using all the basic concepts seen in the previous unit. Keep in mind that we will focus on the logic of the algorithm and not on the graphical part of the program.

As a "plus", you can add an unspecified operation to the calculator. This option is not mandatory, but it will give you an advantage in the final grade of the workshop as long as it works correctly.

Format: C++

Development: individual

Deliverable: C++ file containing the developed algorithm.
